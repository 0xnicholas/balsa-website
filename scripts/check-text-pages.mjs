/**
 * The text-page gate (SPEC §4.1/§4.2/§2.5/§2.6/§5.5/§9.2, ticket #30) over the built `/about`
 * and the two legal stubs: /about's skeleton in order — H1, the public tagline verbatim, Our
 * story ×3, Who's behind it (the signature one `@0xnicholas` link to the maintainer profile,
 * never a name or an email), the closing invitation band with its GitHub · Issues pair and the
 * one back-to-home link — its red lines (no years outside the `© 2026` license line, no ADR or
 * issue numbers, no careers / funding content, no external link beyond the handle, GitHub and
 * Issues) — and its single entry (the footer Project column: the home body never links it).
 * The legal stubs carry their H1, the shared static `Last updated` line (shape and sameness
 * pinned, the value the launch day's one edit) and the locked paragraphs, contact through
 * GitHub Issues only, and no SaaS contract clauses or named hosting platform. The rules live
 * in `src/lib/text-page-rules.ts`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/check-text-pages.mjs [--root <dir>] [--dist <dir>]
