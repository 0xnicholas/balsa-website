/**
 * The keyword pages (SPEC §4.4) over the built site: the skeleton — the §2.6 title
 * (`<Keyword> for TypeScript — Balsats`), the H1 (the keyword's face plus its claim), 2–4
 * argument sections (a subheading plus 1–3 sentences), exactly one `Learn more` text link,
 * the in-page FAQ (4–5 questions, zero overlap with the global nine, 1–3-sentence
 * self-contained answers, no links), the shared final CTA and the back-to-home anchor — and
 * the page-level red lines: RAG / evals nowhere in the page's own copy, no code block, no
 * links between keyword pages, no Platform-class words, and no release status outside the
 * §6.2 switch points.
 *
 * The in-page FAQ wears its own marker (`data-page-faq`): the global FAQ gate owns `data-faq`
 * and demands the §3.7 nine of any page carrying it, while a keyword page carries the page
 * FAQ instead (ticket #28's handoff note). The `Learn more` href is the pre-launch constant
 * from `src/lib/links.ts` until the docs switch (#16) flips the mapping to its `post` values —
 * the constant, this gate's expectation and `allowedExternalLinks` move together.
 *
 * Vocabulary note: the locked §4.4 copy names the supervisor / sub-agent concepts in
 * negation ("no supervisor protocol", "no sub-agent concept"), so the CONTEXT.md term guards
 * do not scan these pages — the verbatim locks pin every word by construction, which is the
 * guards' purpose served by the lock itself.
 *
 * Like the hero, feature, band, FAQ and scenario rules, the strings here are the spec's copy —
 * deliberately not read from the content collections that render them, so the page and its
 * gate cannot agree by construction. All four pages' §4.4 copy is registered now【终稿·勿改】;
 * the gate checks the pages the build has and reports the rest as pending, like the shell
 * gate.
