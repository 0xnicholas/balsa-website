/**
 * The global FAQ ×9 (SPEC §3.7) over the built page: the `#faq` section, its heading, nine
 * `<details>` pairs whose questions and answers are the §3.7 copy verbatim and in order, no link
 * inside an answer, and the nine answers' iron rules — no install command, no competitor name, no
 * counting figure, no foreign package scope, the CONTEXT.md vocabulary, and the RAG / evals line
 * that only question 7 answers (SPEC §9.2). The answers also keep the §5.5 audited text roles on
 * the page background (`src/lib/colour-rules.ts`), like the home bands. Question 2 is publishing
 * switch point #2 (SPEC §6.2): the constant here is the pre-release draft, and no install command
 * may be written before the switch is decided.
 *
 * Like the hero, feature and band rules, the strings here are the spec's copy — deliberately not
 * read from the content collection that renders them, so the page and its gate cannot agree by
 * construction.

	{
		question: 'What is Balsats?',
		answer:
			'Balsats is an ultralight TypeScript agent framework. Its surface is agents, tools, memory, workflows and durable execution, with capability packages you add as you need them. It is lightweight in two precise senses: you compose only what you use, and it asks for no runtime of its own — no database, no queue, no long-running process; it embeds in the app you already run.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Is Balsats on npm yet?',
		answer:
			'Not yet. The first public release will be 0.5.0, with the framework and its capability packages shipping together. Until then, the repository on GitHub is where to follow along — star or watch it for release updates.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Why another TypeScript agent framework?',
		answer:
			"Because the useful parts of a framework should behave like a library, not a platform. Every subsystem ships behind its own subpath export and the core carries zero runtime dependencies, so what you don't import costs you nothing — not in the dependency tree, not in concept space. Nothing here needs a database, a queue or a long-running process, and a CI byte budget keeps size a checked property rather than a promise.",
	},
	{
		question: 'What models and providers can I use with Balsats?',
		answer:
			'Any model from the AI SDK provider ecosystem: you pass a model instance straight from a provider package, with no adapter, no registry and no magic strings. The core stays dependency-free by keeping a minimal structural model contract. For streaming into an AI SDK UI, @balsats/ai-sdk provides the message-stream interop and a useChat-compatible route.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Does Balsats run on edge and serverless?',
		answer:
			"Yes — nothing in the architecture requires a database, a queue or a long-running process, and the core has zero runtime dependencies. Serverless and edge deployments are a first-class shape rather than a downgrade: a platform cron calling tick() on an endpoint is the canonical way to run schedules. Capability packages carry their own runtime requirements — the SQLite adapter targets Node — and the core's declared runtime is Node 22.13 or newer; Bun, Deno and Workers are not promised.",
	},
	{
		question: 'Does Balsats support MCP?',
		answer:
			"Yes. @balsats/mcp-server serves your tools over MCP through HTTP or stdio, and @balsats/mcp-client brings another server's tools in as ordinary Balsats tools — plain objects, no registry. Both ship with the first release.",
	},
	{
		question: 'Does Balsats support RAG or evals?',
		answer:
			"No — neither is built in. Both sit on the framework's deferred list and will be reopened against real use-case signals, with no schedule promised. Eval-style assertions can already hang off processors, and observability is built in: a tracer with spans, exportable to any OTLP collector with GenAI semantic conventions.",
	},
	{
		question: 'Is Balsats production-ready?',
		answer:
			'Pre-1.0: everything this site describes is implemented and verified, but 0.x releases reserve the right to make breaking changes, and 1.0 is not scheduled. Pin the version you build against and follow releases — storage ports become additive-only from 1.0.',
	},
	{
		question: "What's the license?",
